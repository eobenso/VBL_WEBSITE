        <p> Volunteer librarians (librarianettes) at VBL are the primary caretakers of the space, collection, and users during
            opening hours. They are in charge of opening and closing the library, as well as reshelving books, helping users find and check
            out books, updating collection databases, and cleaning the library. They may also be asked to prepare the space for events, 
            coordinate with staff, and catalog books.
